# Inswapper128_pytorch_unofficial
Unofficial Inswapper (Pytorch Inswapper model with Trainable Parameters)

This is the Inswapper PyTorch version, which is 99.999999% the same as the Inswapper128.onnx (almost, or maybe equivalent)
* It provides a detailed model architecture (with optimisable pre-trained model)
* It can be used as a strong backbone for the face identity swap model.
